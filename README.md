# About this Project

This project is an effort by members of the National TSA Discord to update the National TSA Bylaws.

We find that there are many issues with the current set, and we're working together to change that. That means things like adding provisions for the cancellation of National Conference and preventing massive regulation changes mid-year.

We welcome you to open a pull request on our [repository.](https://github.com/tsadiscord/bylaw-amendments)
