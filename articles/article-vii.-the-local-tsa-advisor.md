# Article VII. The Local TSA Advisor

It is recommended that a technology education teacher serve as a chapter TSA advisor; however, in cases where there is no such interested teacher, a state certified educator may be appointed by the school's principal. The appointed advisor would have all the rights and privileges of a regular advisor as long as that chapter is in good standing.
