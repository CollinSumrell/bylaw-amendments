# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to work for a better future for TSA. We welcome \(and encourage\) input from all members of TSA that wish to contribute, but we do have some rules:

* All changes shall be done by pull requests to allow for input from others.
* Along with the changes to the Bylaws you're proposing, be sure to accomplish the following:
  * If you make or delete an article, make sure to update the [SUMMARY.md file](https://github.com/tsadiscord/bylaw-amendments/blob/master/SUMMARY.md).
  * Either create a new amendment under the [amendments folder](https://github.com/tsadiscord/bylaw-amendments/tree/master/amendments), or add your changes to an existing amendment.
    * Your amendment file should only contain the name of your amendment, your GitHub username, the pull request that your amendment is a part of \(you may have to submit your pull request and then add a commit with the changes to the amendment file in it after you submit it\), and a notice that similar changes should be added to that event. Check the [Financial Transparency](https://github.com/tsadiscord/bylaw-amendments/tree/master/amendments/financial-transparency.md) amendment for an example.
* All changes will need to be approved by the GitHub organization admins before they're officially added. We'll make sure to give time for community discussion before pull requests are merged or not.
