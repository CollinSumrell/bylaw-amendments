# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to work for a better future for TSA. We welcome \(and encourage\) input from all members of TSA that wish to contribute, but we do have some rules:

* All changes shall be done by pull requests to allow for input from others.
* Along with the changes to the Bylaws you're proposing, be sure to accomplish the following:
  * If you make or delete an article, make sure to update the [SUMMARY.md file](https://github.com/tsadiscord/bylaw-amendments/blob/master/SUMMARY.md).
* All changes will need to be approved by the GitHub organization admins before they're officially added. We'll make sure to give time for community discussion before pull requests are merged or not.
* After your changes are merged, we'll add your changes to an existing amendment that's about a similar subject, or we'll create a new amendment for it.
